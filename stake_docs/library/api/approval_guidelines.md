General Requirements
--------------------

When a game is submitted for approval, Stake Engine technical support will review its suitability for publication on Stake’s platform. Approval requests will be actioned for a specific frontend and math version. Our team will inspect the game for functionality, clarity, communication, and technical performance. These factors determine the suitability of your game for publication. Stake Engine will communicate any issues or concerns, providing requested changes and reasoning for approval or rejection on a case-by-case basis.

Approval requests must be accompanied by a short blurb describing your game theme and mechanics for use in promotional material and the game description tag.

Key Restrictions
----------------

*   Stake Engine games are strictly _stateless_: Each bet must be independent of previous outcomes. Games cannot include jackpots, gamble features, continuation, or early cashout options.
*   Team names, game titles, and assets must comply with intellectual property/copyright law. Infringement is grounds for rejection.
*   Games must be original designs. Pre-purchased or licensed games existing on other third-party websites will not be permitted.
*   Game assets cannot include material with Stake™ branding or themes.
*   Approval is at the discretion of the reviewer. Games deemed offensive, explicit, in poor taste, or of insufficient quality may be rejected.
*   Games that promote, encourage, or are likely to appeal to underage persons are not permitted. This includes artistic depictions of children or child-like characters in any gambling context.
*   Games will be automatically considered for publication on [stake.us](https://stake.us/) under the condition that they abide by **_strict language requirements_** (see _Jurisdiction Requirements_ below). Stake Engine offers a _social mode_ setting within the play modal to test social languages.

Post Release Notes
------------------

Ensure that when submitting a review request, **the game is finalized and ready for publication**.

Once a game has been approved for publication on Stake/Stake-US, only minor updates to address visual issues are permitted, unless otherwise requested by the Stake Engine team. Changes to the underlying math model, the addition of new game modes, or modifications to gameplay mechanics will not be allowed.
