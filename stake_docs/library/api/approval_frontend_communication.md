Frontend and Communication
--------------------------

Frontend checks will include reviewing in-game performance and display to ensure the game is free of visual bugs, has the necessary industry-standard User Interface (UI) components, and behaves as described in the game rules.

Game Communication
------------------

### Game Display

*   Submitted games must use unique audio and visual assets. Assest such as backgrounds, symbols and/or animations provided with the _web-sdk_ sample games will not be approved for publication.
*   Ensure the game is free of visual bugs, including broken or missing assets or animations.
*   Popout view support: Stake offers players to option to use the ‘mini-player’ modal to play games in the background. Games must support this small view without the active game board been visibly distorted.
*   The game must support mobile view for commonly used devices, with all UI functionality remaining usable during screen scaling.
*   All images and fonts must be loaded from the Stake Engine Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### Rules and Paytable

*   Game information must be accessible from the UI, including a detailed description of all game rules.
*   If multiple game modes are available, provide a description of the cost of each bet and the actions being purchased.
*   The RTP of the game (and each mode, if applicable) must be clearly communicated to the player.
*   The maximum win amount for each mode must be clearly displayed.
*   Payout amounts for all symbol combinations must be presented.
*   If the game includes special symbols (e.g., cash prizes or multipliers), list all obtainable values.
*   For feature modes (e.g., triggered by Scatter symbols), describe how to access them. Example: “3 Scatters award 10 free spins; 4 Scatters award 15 spins …”

UI Components
-------------

*   Game must include a User Interface guide, briefly describing the functionality of UI buttons.
*   The game must allow players to change the bet size.
*   Player must be able to use all bet-levels returned within RGS auth/ response.
*   The player’s current balance must be displayed.
*   Final win amounts must be clearly shown for non-zero payout results.
*   If an outcome contains multiple winning actions, the payout amount must incrementally update to match the final payout multiplier.
*   The UI must include an option to disable sounds.
*   The spacebar must be mapped to the _bet button_.
*   If an ‘autoplay’ feature is present, the player must confirm the autoplay action, games are not allowed to automatically place consecutive bets with one click.

Other Checks
------------

*   Check the network tab to ensure no errors or game information is being logged.
*   Playtest the game to verify it behaves as described in the rules (e.g., validating payout combinations).
*   Game will be tested with various combinations of currencies and languages.
*   If the game has a ‘fastplay’ option: wins amounts, winning symbol combinations and pop-up information and must still be legible to player.
