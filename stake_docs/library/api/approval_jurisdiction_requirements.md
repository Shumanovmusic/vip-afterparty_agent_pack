Jurisdiction Requirements
-------------------------

For games to be avaliable on stake.us, US requriements prohibit the use of certain gambling terms. This predominantly applies to game rules but also potentially extends to images and UI elments. For your game to be approved for release on stake.us, your game cannot contain any of the terms listed below.

The RGS uses the URL query parameter `social=true/false` to indicate wheather or not the game is loaded in a ‘social’ casino. We reccomend using an additional language file with the prefix: `sweeps_<lang>` to handle phrase changes.

A table of prohibited terms is given below, along with suggested replacement phrases:

| Restricted Phrase | Replacement Phrase |
| --- | --- |
| win feature | play feature |
| pay out | win / won |
