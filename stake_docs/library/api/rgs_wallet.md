Markdown Content:
The wallet endpoints enable interactions between the RGS and the Operator’s Wallet API, managing the player’s session and balance operations.

Authenticate Request
--------------------

Validates a `sessionID` with the operator. This must be called before using other wallet endpoints. Otherwise, they will throw `ERR_IS` (invalid session).

### Round

The `round` returned may represent a currently active or the last completed round. Frontends should continue the round if it remains active.

### Request

```
POST /wallet/authenticate
```

```
{
  "sessionID": "xxxxxxx",
}
```

### Response
