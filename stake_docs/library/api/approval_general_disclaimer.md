General Game Disclaimer
=======================

The game rules/information popup must include a brief disclaimer regarding game operation. Since Stake Engine utilises pre-calculated game results, payouts are dictated purely by the RGS response and are not influenced by events on the frontend. You are able to use our template disclaimer, or your own, so long as the same message is clearly conveyed.

### General Disclaimer:

Malfunction voids all wins and plays. A consistent internet connection is required. In the event of a disconnection, reload the game to finish any uncompleted rounds. The expected return is calculated over many plays. The game display is not representative of any physical device and is for illustrative purposes only. Winnings are settled according to the amount received from the Remote Game Server and not from events within the web browser. TM and © 2025 Stake Engine.
